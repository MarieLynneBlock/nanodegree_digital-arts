00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,710
As a graphic designer,

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,175
my biggest job is to solve problems for my clients.

3
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:09,105
Usually, this means creating what we call a brand identity.

4
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:12,645
Simply put, this is the logo for the client and then any and

5
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:16,605
all materials and items that may have their logo applied to them.

6
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:19,790
One very special client was a group of young people in

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,680
Nicaragua who had started a furniture business using recycled wooden pallets.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,375
It was very important to them that the logo captured not just their brand name,

9
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,150
but represented the fact that the raw materials that

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,365
they were using in their company were in fact recycled.

11
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:37,655
Because of this environmental angle,

12
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:40,670
they really wanted their brand to use the color green.

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:46,115
Part of my design process is to look for inspiration and research my clients.

14
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:48,875
As they were using palettes to create furniture,

15
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,805
my immediate go-to for inspiration was, of course, pallets.

16
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:58,295
On this slide, you can see my initial drafts and thought processes for development.

17
00:00:58,295 --> 00:01:01,610
You will find your own style and process as you begin to learn

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,835
more and you will find out what works best for you.

19
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:10,220
For me, I like to throw all of my ideas onto the art board and see what sticks.

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,705
I then go back and further refine ideas before I present to the client.

21
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:16,820
Sometimes the client says,

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,365
"You know what, I actually like something from the first round better."

23
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:22,580
They were really happy with the end result.

24
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,070
They felt like this logo made them look professional,

25
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,375
but not too corporate,

26
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,825
and that it showed the world what they were all about.

27
00:01:28,825 --> 00:01:32,660
In here, is an example of the logo applied to both print items like

28
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:38,310
this t-shirt and a digital example as well with a group social media homepage
