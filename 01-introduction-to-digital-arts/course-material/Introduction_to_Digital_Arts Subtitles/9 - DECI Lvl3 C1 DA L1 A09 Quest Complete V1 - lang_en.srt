00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,065
Congratulations, you have just completed your first lesson.

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:06,120
We have learned so much already.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,315
To recap, we now know that the practices of digital art and graphic design create most,

4
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:16,270
if not all of the visuals we see around us in our everyday life.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,750
We have learned that most of

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,830
this digital art work is created using vector-based graphics,

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,660
and that these can be produced at any size with the exact same results.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,065
We also learned about the elements and principles,

9
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:32,425
the basic building blocks of design,

10
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:37,325
and we learned how to implement the first to the elements line using Canva,

11
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:39,190
a free open-source software.

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,010
Wow, we covered so much already.

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,800
You are well on your way to becoming digital artists and graphic designers.
