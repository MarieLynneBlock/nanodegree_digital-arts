00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
Have you ever wondered how billboards are designed?

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,615
Or the advertisements you see on the sides of buildings or buses?

3
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:10,620
Conversely, have you ever paid attention to the design of a postage stamp?

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,980
Or seeing small graphics perhaps on social media and wondered how they were created.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,585
Well, they were created one of two ways, vector or raster.

6
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:23,910
In a nutshell, raster designs are

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,915
pixel-based and their quality is dependent on their size.

8
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:33,660
Have you ever tried to enlarge a photo and suddenly got distorted or blurry?

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,645
This is because it's based on something called pixels.

10
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:39,540
The second avenue is vector-based graphics,

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,930
and this is where we will focus on.

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,925
Before we dive into that though,

13
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:46,615
let's take a moment to learn what vectors are.

14
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:52,850
In simple terms, a vector is something like an object with both magnitude and direction.

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,425
Look at that little boat.

16
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:56,690
The magnitude of the boat would be its length,

17
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,470
and the direction would be the arrow moving across the screen to the right.

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:05,370
Now, the river could turn a bend or the boat could change its direction,

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,920
so there is the possibility for

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,870
many different vectors using the boat in the river, for example.

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,650
In the design world,

22
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,215
the vectors we will be working with will scale

23
00:01:15,215 --> 00:01:19,070
up or down so their direction will be outwards or inwards,

24
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,315
and their magnitude will change with the scale of the object.

25
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:26,360
All of this is a fancy way of saying that no matter what you create,

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,405
whether it's small like a postage stamp or big like a billboard advertisement,

27
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:36,140
at any size it will look exactly the same.

28
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:42,760
You can scale up or down infinitely without compromising the integrity of the visual.

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,395
It is a really cool feature in the design world.

30
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:47,975
The software does all of the math for us.

31
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,450
So if you were worried because you thought you stumbled

32
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,165
into a math class by mistake, have no fear.

33
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:57,145
We just needed a basic understanding of how it all works.

34
00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:59,510
What does that mean for you as a designer?

35
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,265
It means that by using a computer or tablet and vector-based software,

36
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:10,410
you have the capability to design anything for any project of any size.
