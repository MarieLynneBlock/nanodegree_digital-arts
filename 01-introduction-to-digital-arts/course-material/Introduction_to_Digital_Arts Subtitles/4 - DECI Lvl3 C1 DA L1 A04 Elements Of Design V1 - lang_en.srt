00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,295
Now we have a general idea of the space and type of artwork we will be creating.

2
00:00:05,295 --> 00:00:07,995
Let's talk a little about the basics of design.

3
00:00:07,995 --> 00:00:10,485
These are what we call the elements of design.

4
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:14,385
Here's some of the elements we will talk about throughout our learning journey.

5
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:18,180
A line. A line is actually an elongated point.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,415
It is the most basic of all of the elements. A shape.

7
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:25,920
A shape is the general outline of something,

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,415
or a closed form or closed path.

9
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:34,245
Color. Now color is perhaps the element we are most familiar with.

10
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:35,640
In the digital world,

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,345
we will learn about additive colors, RGB.

12
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:42,315
Now, RGB stands for red, green, and blue,

13
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:47,170
and all of the colors that you see on the screen are made up of those three colors.

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:54,035
Space. Now space is otherwise referred to as figure ground or negative space.

15
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:57,110
This refers to the space around the objects and it is as

16
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,445
much an element as the objects themselves.

17
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:03,230
Typography. Now, most people don't even

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,990
think about the letters they see on the screen or in print.

19
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,615
They just read the information provided.

20
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:12,020
But typography itself is an art form.

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,735
Lastly, we have texture.

22
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:17,990
In the digital world, we can't create texture that we can

23
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,125
physically feel or tactile texture.

24
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:27,530
Instead, we create visual texture or artworks that look like it has texture.

25
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,090
In this first example,

26
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,760
we have something similar to a quick pencil sketch.

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,460
The second example is radial and it appears like the screen has a rounded texture to it.

28
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,680
The third example is layered shapes that give some depth by mimicking shadow.

29
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,670
It's good to know that we can use texture to help give dimension.

30
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,010
The elements are the backbone of design.

31
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,385
They are the building blocks for all of your digital creations.

32
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:56,360
Both those who create artwork as a hobby and the professionals who create

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,380
brands for international companies all rely on these elements
