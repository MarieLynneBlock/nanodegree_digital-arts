1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,165
Now, let's learn how to create digitally.

2
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:08,415
Throughout this course, we will be working with free open-source software called Canva.

3
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:12,765
There are many different options for designing and creating artwork on the computer.

4
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:16,155
Here are some steps we will take to complete this activity.

5
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:21,510
Let's start this exercise by opening Canva on our computers and setting up our accounts.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,505
I've just opened Canva,

7
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:25,350
and this is what you see when you'll open it.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,675
Up here in the upper right-hand corner is a button that says create, design.

9
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:34,010
If we hover over that, we get this drop-down menu.

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,080
We're going to go down to Custom Size.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,125
There's lots of built-in sizes that are already there;

12
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,475
templates and whatnot,

13
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:43,640
but if we go down here to the bottom and click "Custom size",

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,870
we get this drop-down menu.

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,715
Let's go ahead and make 1,000 pixels by 1,000 pixels.

16
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:53,165
That gives us a nice square to work with and so go ahead,

17
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:58,110
you can hit those numbers and click "Create new design".

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,240
What do we have here?

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,415
We have a blank artboard and to give you a little tour of Canva.

20
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:05,675
This is your artboard,

21
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:07,080
this is the workable space,

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,245
and over here on the left,

23
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:11,720
we've got some built-in features.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,580
On the far left, we've got our main components of the software.

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,410
Let's go ahead and click on "Elements".

26
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,870
Right here we have some built-in elements,

27
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,220
and why don't we go ahead and click on lines and shapes?

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,810
It's right here, it's the second one down.

29
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,705
Learning about lines, we can see that there's some built-in line functions here in Canva.

30
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:40,470
We can click on any of these.

31
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,800
Here is a solid line and it pops up right in

32
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,170
the center and so there are a few things about this that we can look at.

33
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,970
If we look at these little arrows right here and hover over it,

34
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,800
you can see that it turns purple,

35
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,915
and if we hold down our mouse,

36
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:57,655
we can see that we can rotate this line in any direction.

37
00:01:57,655 --> 00:02:03,380
There's the angle that pops up and there's also these two circles on the side that

38
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,915
we can drag in any direction to create the line length,

39
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:12,070
whether we want it longer or shorter.

40
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,085
If we go up here to this toolbar,

41
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:20,065
this first one is where we can change the color of our line.

42
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:23,315
We can give it any color we like;

43
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:26,240
purple, red, it doesn't matter.

44
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,675
Let's stick with this purple that we have right here and then this next one, line style.

45
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:38,170
This is where we can change it from a solid line to a dotted line,

46
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,735
change the size of the dots.

47
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:44,050
Right here is how we make the line thicker.

48
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,490
The higher the number, the heavier the weight.

49
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,495
If we go back to our solid line,

50
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:52,925
we can see that this is a nice thick line.

51
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:55,700
Then one last little thing here,

52
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,415
if we toggle this on and off,

53
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:01,715
that gives us a nice rounded edge to our lines

54
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:05,450
instead of the straight looking almost like a rectangle.

55
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,850
That's a nice way to soften those.

56
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,665
We can go ahead and decrease the weight of that.

57
00:03:11,665 --> 00:03:13,770
A couple of other things.

58
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,845
If you have this clicked,

59
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:19,310
we can add ends to our lines as well.

60
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,455
If we want it to be an arrow or a circle at the end,

61
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,630
this is a way that we can change our lines.

62
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,775
We can also change it from a straight to an elbow line.

63
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:34,550
If we go ahead and click out of that,

64
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,245
we have a line here.

65
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:38,375
That's one way to create a line.

66
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:45,225
The second way that we can create a line in Canva is by using the draw tools here.

67
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,280
On the left-hand side,

68
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,245
if we click on Draw,

69
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:53,730
we get some markers and some different size things that pop up.

70
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:59,290
Go ahead and click on this marker and we can just free-hand a line.

71
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,335
Obviously, this isn't as clean as the straight lines that Canva gives us,

72
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:08,015
and it gives us a much more organic or natural field to the line.

73
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:11,735
Again, for my artists out there who like to freehand draw things,

74
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:14,310
this might be a tool that's good for you.
