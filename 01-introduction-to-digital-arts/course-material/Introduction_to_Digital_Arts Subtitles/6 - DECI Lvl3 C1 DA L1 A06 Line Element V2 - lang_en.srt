1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,685
Line. It seems so simple.

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:05,340
We study them, we draw them,

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,910
and we hardly ever think about them. They are just there.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,970
But there's a lot more to it.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,065
Let's take a closer look at the most basic of elements line.

6
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:18,810
Let's get right to the point. That's right.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,790
The point, take out a pen or a pencil and make a dot on a piece of paper.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,485
That dot in the digital realm is actually a line.

9
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:29,940
It is in fact,

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,985
the smallest unit of line and it only gets bigger from there.

11
00:00:33,985 --> 00:00:37,335
Now, I want you to repeat that simple exercise,

12
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:42,100
but drag the pen or pencil across the paper and you have a line,

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,290
which is actually just an elongated point.

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:50,300
When we create this elongated point or line on the computer,

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,595
we are creating something that has magnitude and direction.

16
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:57,215
When something has those two things,

17
00:00:57,215 --> 00:00:58,955
what do we know to be true?

18
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:01,670
Yes, that is correct.

19
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,040
The digital line is a vector graphic.

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,290
This simplest of all elements.

21
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,975
Lines can have many different qualities.

22
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:11,330
They can be straight or wavy,

23
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,265
and they can be downright curly.

24
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:15,665
They can be solid or broken.

25
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:18,455
They can snake across the entire screen,

26
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:20,705
or they can appear just at the edges.

27
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,500
They can be thick or very narrow.

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,065
A general rule of thumb with line is this.

29
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:30,275
They're usually longer than they are wide.

30
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:33,710
Let's take a closer look at some of the categories of line.

31
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,060
We have solid, which is one continuous line.

32
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,890
Implied line. This can be dotted or dashed.

33
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,630
Although technically each dot or dash is a line,

34
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,990
the human eye will see it as one continuous line.

35
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,455
That is because of something called gestalt.

36
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:54,785
Now, gestalt simply means that we see the entire dashed line as one unit,

37
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:59,495
instead of seeing each dash as an individual unit. Line of vision.

38
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:02,435
This is the movement as your eye looks at the composition,

39
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:06,185
it is also called the line of movement or directional line.

40
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:08,600
Lines can be used for many functions.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,630
They can make shapes and forms,

42
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,955
they can create borders and edges,

43
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:16,640
and they can help organize and assist someone in how they look at a design.

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,520
In fact, line has its own style.

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,390
If the main element is line then the style is called linear
