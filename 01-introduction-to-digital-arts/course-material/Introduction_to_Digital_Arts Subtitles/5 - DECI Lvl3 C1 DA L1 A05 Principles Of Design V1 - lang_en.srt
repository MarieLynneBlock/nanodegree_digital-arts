1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
Line, shape, color, space,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,410
type, and texture are the basic building blocks of design.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,515
Now, let's look at how to turn these individual objects into an effective visual design.

4
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:18,105
We do this by using what are called the principles of design.

5
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:20,940
They are balance and scale.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,850
Balance is visual stability,

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,200
meaning that there is an even distribution of the elements in the composition,

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,820
like you see in this example.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,335
Scale is the size of the elements.

10
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:34,820
These two work hand in hand together.

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,355
Even though the odd number of circles we see are all different scales,

12
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:41,380
because of their visual placement,

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,985
the composition remains balanced.

14
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:45,835
Contrast and pattern.

15
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:48,620
Opposing elements that play off of each other,

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,215
like these white circles against that dark blue background can often turn into patterns.

17
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:57,670
That is why these two go hand in hand most of the time.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,740
Movement. When you think of movement,

19
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,660
think of the rhythm of a song.

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,820
A composition should have elements that move the eye around the page.

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:16,055
Emphasis. Now, emphasis is about visual hierarchy or order of visual importance.

22
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:18,890
On the screen, you can see that this center circle

23
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,070
has been made larger than all of the other elements.

24
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,935
This is a visual clue that it may be more important than the other elements.

25
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:31,610
Unity. Now a good way to describe unity is when all of

26
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,230
the individual elements worked so well together that they make up a whole composition.

27
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,360
These are a little bit more advance,

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,775
so we won't worry too much about them now.

29
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:43,190
However, you will begin to see

30
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,420
these words and it is important to know what we are referencing.

31
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,600
Before long, you will have a solid knowledge of

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,420
both the elements and the principles of design.
