00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
Even though this is supposed to be a learning journey about digital arts,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,285
you'll be asked to draw by hand as well.

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:08,790
Sometimes it is helpful as designers to first

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,020
create a hand drawing as part of the design process.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,045
Even if you feel like you don't know how to draw, it's okay.

6
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:17,280
You won't be graded on your sketches.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,910
Take out a piece of paper or open your sketchbook if you have

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,070
plain unlined paper and may work best for you and grab something to draw with.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,855
For this demo, I want you to take out a piece of paper or open your sketch book.

10
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:33,300
If you have plain unlined paper,

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,685
it will probably work best for you.

12
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:37,520
Grab something to draw with.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,215
I prefer a marker.

14
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:43,480
Let's spend a couple of minutes trying to recreate the artwork that you see.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,025
Try to draw one continuous line across the page without lifting or stopping.

16
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:52,325
Notice how the quality of the line changes.

17
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:54,590
When you go to draw the next line,

18
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,785
perhaps you start from the opposite side of the paper.

19
00:00:57,785 --> 00:01:00,590
Adapt your next line to the quality of

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,300
the first line and repeat until you have created something that you are happy with.

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,090
There's no need to fill the entire sheet unless you want to.
