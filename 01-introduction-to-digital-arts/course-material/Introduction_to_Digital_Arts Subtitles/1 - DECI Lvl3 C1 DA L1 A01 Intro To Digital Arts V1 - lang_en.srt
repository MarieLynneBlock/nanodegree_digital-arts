00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,675
Welcome to the exciting world of digital arts and graphic design.

2
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:06,945
Take a minute to look around you. What do you see?

3
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:10,740
Books, computers, mobile devices.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,380
Perhaps the TV is on or you can see advertisements on billboards or in a magazine.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,720
All of these things have been created with the help

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,075
of digital artists and graphic designers.

7
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:23,520
Digital art, simply put,

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,770
is any artwork created digitally,

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,810
stall on a computer,

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,670
a mobile phone, for example.

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,935
Anyone who creates art on a computer is a digital artists.

12
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:39,640
Many digital artist create work for both personal and commercial purposes.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,645
A graphic designer is also a digital artist.

14
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:47,075
One who, in addition to creating artwork,

15
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:49,775
also helps create the more explicit messaging

16
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:52,940
like text that generally goes with the art work.

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,845
This is a simple example of a difference between the two.

18
00:00:56,845 --> 00:01:01,205
Keep in mind though, that some digital artists use words in their practice,

19
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:04,955
and not every graphic designer will use words all of the time.

20
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:07,670
They are two very interrelated avenues

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,525
that really come down to what you wish to call yourself.

22
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:13,190
Therefore, you may see me using

23
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,200
the words digital artist and graphic designer interchangeably.

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,620
The job of a digital artist or graphic designer is to be a problem-solver.

25
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,545
We provide visual solutions that can,

26
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:29,480
for instance, persuade you to buy something or to not buy something.

27
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,040
We can educate you on

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,555
public safety measures can charm you with cute images of baby animals.

29
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:37,835
We brand companies big and small,

30
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:41,990
and create visual components so recognizable that when you see them,

31
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,310
you know exactly what the company is without even seeing the brand name.

32
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,320
The role of the graphic designer can be as

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,960
exciting as giving your favorite brand's image.

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,300
Think about large companies who we instantly

35
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,045
recognize without even having to see their names,

36
00:01:56,045 --> 00:02:01,175
think of the swoosh symbol and athletic wear or another very famous swooping arrow

37
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:06,300
delivering packages or a very famous piece of fruit with a bite taken out of it.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,050
All of these symbols were made by graphic designers
